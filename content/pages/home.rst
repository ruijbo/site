Rui Jorge Oliveira holds a degree in Geological Engineering (University of Aveiro (UA), 2010) and a master degree in Geological Engineering, in the field of Geological Resources (UA, 2014). Currently, is a Ph.D. Candidate of the Doctoral Program in Earth and Space Sciences (Specialty: Geophysics) at the University de Évora (UÉ). Before, he was an undergraduate student in Physical Engineering at UA. He began his scientific research in 2013 as a research fellow at the former Geophysics Centre of Évora, in Applied Geophysics in the detection of seismic faults. As part of the Ph.D. research and as a member of the Institute of Earth Sciences (ICT) since its foundation in 2015, he has been dedicated to the development of effective methodologies for geophysical prospection of the nearby surface in the detection of archaeological structures and ore deposits. His interests also focus on numerical modeling of geophysical data and digital signal processing techniques. As a student, between 2006 and 2008 at UA, he had academic positions as a representative of the student body at the Pedagogical Commission of the Physics Engineering undergraduate course, student member of the Assembly of the Department of Physics, student member of the Pedagogical Council and representative of the Academic Association in Assembly of the UA. In 2016, he was invited to integrate the Geology panel of the External Evaluation Committees of the Portuguese Agency for Assessment and Accreditation of Higher Education.
